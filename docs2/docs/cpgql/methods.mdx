CPGQL provides several functions for identifying `METHOD` nodes and similar nodes around it.

`METHOD` nodes are one of the most important nodes in a Code Property Graph. 

What do `METHOD` nodes represent exactly?

Take the following program written in _C_:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "42") == 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "It depends!\n");
    exit(42);
  }
  printf("What is the meaning of life?\n");
  exit(0);
}

```

The definition of the `main` function is of course a node of type `METHOD` in the Code Property Graph.
But, maybe unexpectedly, the Code Property Graph for the program above has _9_ nodes of type `METHOD`.




The most important ones are `METHOD`, `METHOD_PARAMETER_IN`, `METHOD_RETURN`, and `MODIFIER`

`cpg.method`, `cpg.methodReturn`, `cpg.methodRef`







This article gives an overview of all the Traversal Steps centered around identifying `METHOD` nodes in a Code Property Graph. The `METHOD` node itself represents.




There are multiple ways of identifying methods using the Joern Shell.
