The Help Directive is a CPGQL Directive which returns textual descriptions of other directives.

If it is executed by itself, it shows an overview of [Top-Level Commands](/joern/top-level-commands):

```java
joern> help 
res0: Helper = Welcome to the interactive help system. Below you find a table of all available
top-level commands. To get more detailed help on a specific command, just type

`help.<command>`.

Try `help.importCode` to begin with.
