Joern is a command-line tools for static code analysis. Joern can
help you find and correct security vulnerabilities in programs with
hundreds of thousands of lines of code, including flaws that are
difficult to detect with fuzzing. It includes an interactive shell and
automation capabilities centered around Code Property Graphs.

This article introduces you to the basics of working with Joern. You
learn how to create and modify Code Property Graphs, how to query them
and about organisational commands. If you have not yet installed
Joern, you can do so by following [these instructions](/install).

## Obtaining the Sample Program

Before you start Joern, you should have a program ready to
analyze. Clone the following git repository which contains a simple
program named `X42`:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ShiftLeftSecurity/x42.git
```

Let us start with a problem statement. Show - without running the
program - that an input exists for which `X42` writes a string to
standard error (STDERR).

```c
// X42.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "42") == 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "It depends!\n");
    exit(42);
  }
  printf("What is the meaning of life?\n");
  exit(0);
}
```

## Starting Joern's Interactive Shell

Launch Joern in your shell:
```
$ joern
```

A console session will start and you will see a prompt:
```java
joern>
```

The prompt you are looking at is the prompt of a Scala-based REPL. If
you have no experience with Scala or read-eval-print-loops, don't
worry, you can accomplish a lot with Joern by focusing only on what
its commands allow you to do. If you _are_ familiar with Scala and
REPLs, you may be pleasantly surprised at the flexibility it provides
you with.

## Importing the Code

We create a Code Property Graph for the `X42` program using the
command `importCode`, which requires the path to the source code to be
passed as a first argument, and a project name as a second
argument. In particular, `importCode` creates a new project directory
and stores a binary representation of the Code Property Graph in it.

```java
joern> importCode(inputPath="./x42/c", projectName="x42-c")
Creating project `x42-c` for code at `x42/c`
... output omitted
res1: Option[Cpg] = Some(io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@31ed46c5)
```

:::note
If you see an error and a return value of `None`, you have probably pointed Joern to the wrong input path for the directory containing the source code for the sample project.

## Querying the Code Property Graph

You are ready to analyze your first program using Joern and the Code
Property Graph. Code analysis in Joern is done using the query
language, a domain-specific language designed specifically for work
with the Code Property Graph. It contains practical representations of
the various nodes found in the Code Property Graph, and useful
functions for querying their properties and relationships between each
other. The top-level entry point into a Code Property Graph loaded in
memory, and the root object of the query Language is `cpg`. If you
evaluate `cpg` at the prompt, the output is underwhelming:

```java
joern> cpg
res2: Cpg = io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@cb0d5241
```

Rest assured, a lot is hidden behind that simple statement. You will
discover the full set of commands in time, but for now, you should
learn a helpful Joern trick: `TAB`-completion. In the Joern prompt,
type `cpg.`, do not press `ENTER`, but instead press `TAB`. You will
see a list of available functions `cpg` supports:
```java
joern> cpg.

```

TAB-completion is available for all query language directives, and for
top-level commands. For more descriptive assistance, use the `help`
command, like so:
```java
joern> help.cpg 
res3: String = """
Upon importing code, a project is created that holds an intermediate
representation called `Code Property Graph`. This graph is a composition of
low-level program representations such as abstract syntax trees and control flow
graphs, but it can be arbitrarily extended to hold any information relevant in
your audit, information about HTTP entry points, IO routines, information flows,
or locations of vulnerable code. Think of Joern as a CPG editor.

In practice, `cpg` is the root object of the query language, that is, all query
language constructs can be invoked starting from `cpg`. For exanple,
`cpg.method.l` lists all methods, while `cpg.finding.l` lists all findings of
potentially vulnerable code."""
```

## Solving the Challenge

Now that we have a good set of basic commands, and a Code Property
Graph loaded in memory, let us return to our `X42` program and the
problem we want to solve using Joern.
To reiterate, the problem statement is _Show that an input exists for
which the X42 program always writes a string to STDERR_. And this is
the `X42` program:
```c
// X42.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "42") == 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "It depends!\n");
    exit(42);
  }
  printf("What is the meaning of life?\n");
  exit(0);
}
```

There are two parts in the problem statement: 1. _does the program
write anything to STDERR?_, and 2. _if there is a call writing to
STDERR, is it conditional on a value passed in as argument to the
`X42` program?

Joern makes answering both questions easy. To answer the first one,
whether the program writes anything to STDERR, we can search for nodes
of type `CALL` in the graph, and use the `filter` directive to only
select those calls which have connections to nodes of type `ARGUMENT`
that have the string `stderr` as the value of their `CODE`
property. We find exactly one:

```java
joern> cpg.call.filter(_.argument.code("stderr")).l
res4: List[Call] = List(
  Call(
    id -> 24L,
    code -> "fprintf(stderr, \"It depends!\\n\")",
    name -> "fprintf",
    order -> 1,
    methodInstFullName -> None,
    methodFullName -> "fprintf",
    argumentIndex -> 1,
    dispatchType -> "STATIC_DISPATCH",
    signature -> "TODO assignment signature",
    typeFullName -> "ANY",
    dynamicTypeHintFullName -> List(),
    lineNumber -> Some(7),
    columnNumber -> Some(4),
    resolved -> None,
    depthFirstOrder -> Some(-8),
    internalFlags -> Some(4)
  )
)
```

With this query we have proven the first part of our problem statement correct, there is a place in the `X42` program that writes to STDERR. Let us move to the second part, the check whether the call that writes something to STDERR is conditional on a value passed as input to the `X42` program. Since we are analyzing a program written in `C`, we will search the Code Property Graph for the conventional `argc` or `argv` parameters of the `main` function as the input that potentially triggers the call which writes to STDERR.

Using the query from the previous step, we can use the `astParent` construct to find out more about the surroundings around the `fprintf` call by moving up in the hierarchy of the abstract syntax tree that is part of the Code Property Graph. Moving up one level in the AST hierarchy gives us a block; not very helpful:

```java
joern> cpg.call.filter(_.argument.code("stderr")).astParent.l
res5: List[AstNode] = List(
  Block(
    id -> 23L,
    code -> "",
    order -> 2,
    argumentIndex -> 2,
    typeFullName -> "void",
    dynamicTypeHintFullName -> List(),
    lineNumber -> Some(6),
    columnNumber -> Some(46),
    depthFirstOrder -> Some(-24),
    internalFlags -> Some(0)
  )
)
```

Another layer up gives us an if statement, much better:

```java
joern> cpg.call.filter(_.argument.code("stderr")).astParent.astParent.l
res6: List[AstNode] = List(
  ControlStructure(
    id -> 11L,
    code -> "if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], \"42\") == 0)",
    columnNumber -> Some(2),
    lineNumber -> Some(6),
    order -> 1,
    parserTypeName -> "IfStatement",
    argumentIndex -> 1,
    depthFirstOrder -> None,
    internalFlags -> None
  )
)
```

The `CODE` property of the `CONTROL_STRUCTURE` node you just found proves the second part of our problem statement correct, the call that writes to STDERR is conditional on `argc` and `argv`. Hence, the whole problem statement is correct.

## Closing the Project

Now that we've finished the analysis, let us close the project, which also unloads the Code Property Graph from memory. You do not have to worry about losing any data, because it will remain on disk in the `x42-c` project you created earlier with `importCode`. Close the project using the aptly-named `close`:

```java
joern> close 
2020-05-08 01:13:01.752 WARN clearing 105 references - this may take some time
2020-05-08 01:13:01.756 WARN cleared all clearable references
res7: Option[io.shiftleft.console.workspacehandling.Project] = Some(
  Project(
    ProjectFile("/home/user/x42/c", "x42-c"),
    /home/user/.shiftleft/joern/workspace/x42-c,
    None
  )
)
```

As a final step, exit Joern:

```java
joern> exit
Bye!
Would you like to save changes? (y/N)
y
saving.
```

Congratulations, you have succesfully queried your first  Code
Property Graph using Joern and its query language. In subsequent
articles, you will learn the more advanced features of Joern and also
how to use it to find your first real-world vulnerability.
