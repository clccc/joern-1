Joern is an
[award-winning](https://www.horst-goertz.de/its-preis-2018/gewinner/preistraeger-6-deutscher-it-sicherheitspreis-2016/preistraeger-2016-2-preis/)
open-source platform for robust query-based analysis of C/C++. It enables mining
large code bases for vulnerabilities using a Scala-based
domain-specific query language and provides the reference
implementation for [code property
graphs](https://fabs.codeminers.org/papers/2014-ieeesp.pdf). With its
fuzzy parsing approach, it is specifically suited for machine learning
applications. Joern serves as the fundament for the commercial SAST
and code exploration products at [ShiftLeft](https://shiftleft.io).
