The Code Property Graph (CPG) is an intermediate code representation
designed for code querying. The core idea it promotes is to merge
multiple different program representations into a joint graph data
structure and allowing queries to be formulated as graph
traversals. In its initial
form as [presented in
2014](https://fabs.codeminers.org/papers/2014-ieeesp.pdf), the CPG
makes available syntactical information, control flow information and
data flow for C/C++ programs. It was later further generalized to host
[multiple different programming
languages](https://blog.shiftleft.io/semantic-code-property-graphs-and-security-profiles-b3b5933517c1),
and [higher-level code representations](https://fabs.codeminers.org/talks/2019-cdl.pdf).
